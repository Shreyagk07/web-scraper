# **Web Scraping with Voice Assistant**

This project involves developing a web scraper that extracts real-time data from a coronavirus tracking website via its API. The data includes information such as current COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and fatalities. The API integration is implemented in the `main.py` file, where all the necessary logic for data extraction is handled.

## **Features**

- **Real-time Data Extraction**: Fetches current COVID-19 statistics including cases, recoveries, and fatalities.
- **Voice Assistant Integration**: Enables users to interact with the system through voice commands.
- **Hands-free Operation**: The voice assistant triggers the web scraper, retrieves data, and reads it aloud to the user.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for web scraping and implementing the voice assistant.
- **Speech Recognition Libraries**: For handling voice input.
- **Text-to-Speech Systems**: To read data aloud to the user.
- **API Integration**: For accessing real-time COVID-19 data.
